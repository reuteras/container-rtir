# RTIR

[RTIR](https://www.bestpractical.com/rtir/), or Request Tracker for Incident Response, is a issue tracking system that provides pre-configured queues and workflows designed for incident response teams. Currently build RTIR based on latest RT (5.X.Y).

Currently I'm only running my _reuteras/docker-rt_ container and not RTIR and this container is primarily for my own testing.
